                        While I've got your attention,
                        let me tell you some interesting facts about myself.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I've been programming since 2012. I have been acting since roughly 2008.
                        <br/>
                        I have a passion for game design and game systems programming.
                        <br/>
                        I DM and play tons of Dungeons & Dragons (5e).
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Thanks for reading!
                        <br/>
